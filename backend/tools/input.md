“Sunday, July 16, 1933 At eight o’clock this morning I met General Johnson at the naval airport at Anacostia where we boarded a Navy hydroplane to go down the bay to the President’s boat, the Sequoia. The weather was cloudy and heavy with a low ceiling, so that, generally speaking, we flew at about 500 feet. We were flying so low that the pilot didn’t want to run the risk of going over the land, so we kept pretty close to the river where we could come down easily, if necessary. It took us fifty minutes to reach the Sequoia. We landed nearby and a rowboat was sent for us. The President had eaten something Saturday that didn't agree with him, so we didn’t see him until one o’clock, when he appeared for dinner. After dinner he went to lie down again, but late in the afternoon he was out on deck. At two o'clock we weighed anchor and started up the Patuxent River, which is said to be the shortest and deepest river in the world. At the point where it flows into Chesapeake Bay it is 60 feet deep and for miles up the river it is very deep, although naturally it becomes somewhat more shallow. It was a beautiful ride up the river. The day was warm without being too hot and there was enough breeze to keep away the mosquitoes, and the scenery was certainly worth looking at. We dropped Colonel Howe at Benedict and went on up as far as we could. We had supper on our way down and all of us got off at Benedict where cars met us and brought us back to Washington. In the party besides those already mentioned were Under Secretary of Agriculture Tugwell, Captain Bernou, the President’s naval aide, and his personal secretary, Miss Le Hand. General Johnson and I had a chance to discuss matters with him somewhat briefly, General Johnson on the Industrial Recovery Control Administration, and I on Public Works. He approved some more of our public works projects, but he sent back to me for further study all items covering flood control and rivers and harbors improvements. He also authorized me, at my request, to take steps to proceed against the cattlemen in Arizona and New Mexico who have had many, many acres of the public domain fenced in for long terms of year is with the sanction of the preceding Republican administrations. I was home shortly after nine o’clock.”

Within an hour, the House voted 322 to 98 to pass it over his objections. The next day, on May 23, 1935, the Senate, with a vote of 54 to 40, failed to override the veto.”

Additional Information: On Sunday, May 26, 1935, while President Franklin D. Roosevelt was aboard the Sequoia, the White House announced the dismissal of over 400 cases related to violations of the National Recovery Act (NRA) rules. The very next day, Monday, May 27, the US Supreme Court delivered its ruling on the Schechter Poultry case, declaring President Roosevelt's National Recovery Act unconstitutional.

During this period, Charles West arrived at Sequoia by seaplane, presumably to discuss the unfolding NRA issue. As the Sequoia sailed, it passed by the USS Arkansas and USS Wyoming. Both naval ships honored the President with a 21-gun salute.

In a related event, Jack Warner, having just arrived in New York City from Europe aboard the White Star Line with his fiancé Ann Alvarado, made his way to Washington, D.C., and then to Annapolis. There, he unexpectedly met director Frank Borzage, who was in the midst of shooting the movie "Shipmates Forever" for Warner Brothers at the Annapolis Naval Academy.

Kelly writes that “In June 1935 Roosevelt required _Sequoia_ to be in New London, CT where from her decks he and Mrs. Roosevelt could watch their son John \[This is incorrect. It was Franklin Jr.\], a member of the Harvard crew, race against Yale on the Thames River.” Navy history brief also indicates that “During the periods 9-27 June 1934 and 12-25 June 1935 the ship made cruises to New London, Connecticut via the inland waterway. It seems _Sequoia_ cruised without passengers to New London, welcomed President and guests on 6-21 to watch the races (below), and then cruised back to Washington, D.C. without passengers.

It was then deactivated as a naval installation in 1947 and placed in caretaker status until it was transferred to the Air Force in late 1948\.  
RMD: _The Chatham Press_: Secretary Knox “was on his way to inspect the Banana River Naval Air Station, when his boat stubbed its nose on our doorstep. Of course it didn’t do very much damage, either the boat or the draw, and the Sequoia proceeded about seventy miles down the Indian River to Melbourne, where there is a basin and facilities for repair.”

Nelson said it was true. Imagine, the Army conducting their air war in secrecy from the Secretary of the Navy, but it was being done that way. He had no understanding of the use of air power at all and backed up the most old-hat, out-of-date admirals.

“DIPLOMATIC APPOINTMENT FOR WOMAN.  
LONDON, November 22\. —Britain's first woman attache,  
described by a Foreign Office colleague as "an extraordinarily bright and attractive brunette,"  
has been appointed to the British Embassy in Washington. She Is Mrs. Betty Gibbs, a widow in her early thirties. She is the second Englishwoman given full diplomatic status. The first was Miss Mary M'Geachy, who also was in Washington. Mrs. Gibbs went to Canada in 1941 demonstrating a British canteen unit, and later took up receptionist work at the British Embassy in Washington. Because all wartime appointments are temporary, Mrs. Gibbs does not rank as a member of the diplomatic service”
