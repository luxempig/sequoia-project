Notes: The Hoover Moratorium was a public statement issued by United States President Herbert Hoover on June 20, 1931, who hoped to ease the coming international economic crisis and provide time for recovery by instituting a one-year moratorium on payments of German and inter-Allied war debt stemming from World War I. The proposal would postpone the repayment of both capital and interest. Many, both in the United States and abroad, were outraged by this idea.[1] “In support of the Hoover Moratorium Laval undertook a year of personal and direct diplomacy by which he traveled to London, Berlin and the United States.” The US Congress did not approve the Hoover Moratorium until December 1931. Laval was found guilty of plotting against the security of the State and collaboration with the enemy, and after a thwarted suicide attempt, he was executed by firing squad in October 15, 1945.[5]


British Security Coordination (BSC)’s Bermuda operation intercepted messages [194?] in which Josette Laval was coordinating Nazi cells in the U.S. on behalf of Vichy/Nazi.
