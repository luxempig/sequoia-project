Location: Washington Marina
Time:
Passengers:
Additional Information: “SAM DONALDSON Well perhaps adding insult to injury to the Democrats, today the presidential yacht returned to Washington. The place was the Washington marina and as Dixieland bands played, the Sequoia came up the Potomac retrieved by a private trust fund from the private ownership to which former President Jimmy Carter relegated it. The Sequoia will be ready for presidential use on July 4th, but White House spokesman, mindful perhaps of the accusations Mr. Reagan travels only in wealthy circles, has said there are no present plans for the President to use the Sequoia. That of course could change.

Additional Information: Sequoia showed the National Flag of the People's Republic of China during the cruise. The CIA published a report “CHINA'S YANG SHANGKUN: GROWING INFLUENCE” on May 6, 1987, two weeks prior to the cruise. Douglas H. Paal (Reagan National Security Council - Director for Asian Affairs) discussed the Bush-Shangkun Sequoia cruise during a May 27, 2019 podcast interview by the Georgetown University Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on Global Issues and expressed his regret that the long conversation during which “Yang went on to describe his revolutionary history in intimate detail over the dinner table” was not recorded. After both Yang Shangkun and George Bush had ascended to the Presidency of their respective countries, a declassified February 8, 1989 State Department Memo prepared to brief President Bush on an upcoming 45-minute phone call with President Yang Shankun refers to detailed discussions during Yang’s May 1987 DC visit regarding the US-China military to military engagement and the importance of including the Pioneer (SS-20 “Saber”) missile systems the Soviet Union had deployed in the far east in the US-Soviet Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty signed December, 8, 1987.
