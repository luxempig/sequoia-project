1933-03-25 Sequoia Commissioned as Presidential Yacht
- 1933-03-26 Chattanooga Daily Times described as “yachtlike” at 96 feet long
- 1933-04-20 Evening Journal gives very detailed description, using words like “comfortable,” “large,” and “inviting”
- 1933-05-04 Lubbock Morning Avalanche calls the Sequoia a “trim little ship”; had undergone renovation between Hoover and FDR
- 1935-11-18 Dayton Daily News discusses replacement of the Sequoia with the Potomac, saying “the Sequoia was not very seaworthy, this being one reason for its abandonment. … the Sequoia, although luxurious, was small.”
- 1936-09-16 Daily Press compares the Sequoia and the Potomac, saying the Sequoia was “a much swankier ship. Built as a private yacht, it had polished oak decks and mahogany paneling, and was far neater than the iron-decked Potomac. But the navy got to worrying about fire hazards, and decided that while the president was in its care he should be safely encased in a boiler plate. … The alterations [to the Potomac] allow the president not only greater safety but also a wider range of movement.”
- 1936-09-28 The Honolulu Star Bulletin says “the Potomac is not superior to the Sequoia. Her speed is no greater … [and] the Potomac’s quarters … are less spacious below than the Sequoia’s.


- 1955-05-09 The Evening Republican says “as far as the capital’s party set is concerned, the most popular ship afloat is a swanky, 104-foot craft called the U.S.S. Sequoia. … The ship, which can accommodate up to 40 persons for buffet and cocktails, is hardly going to waste.

“In 1933, Lie painted a picture of Amberjack II, a yacht on which President Roosevelt cruised, and presented it to the President. It now hangs in the oval room of the White House.”


“A beautiful painting, "Herring Cove at Dawn", painted on the New England coast was purchased by a group of Norwegian Americans in New York for presentation to Crown Prince Olav of Norway and Princess Martha of Sweden at the time of their wedding in 1929. It hangs in their home at Skaugum.”

The London Economic Conference was a meeting of representatives of 66 nations from June 12 to July 27, 1933 at the Geological Museum in London. Its purpose was to win agreement on measures to fight the Great Depression, revive international trade, and stabilize currency exchange rates. It collapsed after it was "torpedoed" by US President Franklin D. Roosevelt in early July when he denounced currency stabilization.

Notes: The Secret Diary of Harold L. Ickes - Page 65 (Sunday, July 16, 1933)
“Sunday, July 16, 1933 At eight o’clock this morning I met General Johnson at the naval airport at Anacostia where we boarded a Navy hydroplane to go down the bay to the President’s boat, the Sequoia. The weather was cloudy and heavy with a low ceiling, so that, generally speaking, we flew at about 500 feet. We were flying so low that the pilot didn’t want to run the risk of going over the land, so we kept pretty close to the river where we could come down easily, if necessary. It took us fifty minutes to reach the Sequoia. We landed nearby and a rowboat was sent for us. The President had eaten something Saturday that didn't agree with him, so we didn’t see him until one o’clock, when he appeared for dinner. After dinner he went to lie down again, but late in the afternoon he was out on deck. At two o'clock we weighed anchor and started up the Patuxent River, which is said to be the shortest and deepest river in the world. At the point where it flows into Chesapeake Bay it is 60 feet deep and for miles up the river it is very deep, although naturally it becomes somewhat more shallow. It was a beautiful ride up the river. The day was warm without being too hot and there was enough breeze to keep away the mosquitoes, and the scenery was certainly worth looking at. We dropped Colonel Howe at Benedict and went on up as far as we could. We had supper on our way down and all of us got off at Benedict where cars met us and brought us back to Washington. In the party besides those already mentioned were Under Secretary of Agriculture Tugwell, Captain Bernou, the President’s naval aide, and his personal secretary, Miss Le Hand. General Johnson and I had a chance to discuss matters with him somewhat briefly, General Johnson on the Industrial Recovery Control Administration, and I on Public Works. He approved some more of our public works projects, but he sent back to me for further study all items covering flood control and rivers and harbors improvements. He also authorized me, at my request, to take steps to proceed against the cattlemen in Arizona and New Mexico who have had many, many acres of the public domain fenced in for long terms of year is with the sanction of the preceding Republican administrations. I was home shortly after nine o’clock.”

Notes: 1935-05-27 Black Monday of the New Deal “The US Supreme Court ruled unanimously against President Franklin D. Roosevelt in three cases challenging the constitutionality of the New Deal, which was a factor leading to Roosevelt's attempt in 1937 to pack the Supreme Court. https://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtid=2&psid=3450 A kosher chicken dealer sued the government, charging that the NRA was unconstitutional. In its famous "dead chicken" decision, Schechter v. the U.S., the court agreed. The case affirmed that Congress had delegated excessive authority to the president and had improperly involved the federal government in regulating interstate commerce. Complained Roosevelt, "We have been relegated to the horse-and-buggy definition of interstate commerce."

Additional Information: On Sunday, May 26, 1935, while President Franklin D. Roosevelt was aboard the Sequoia, the White House announced the dismissal of over 400 cases related to violations of the National Recovery Act (NRA) rules. The very next day, Monday, May 27, the US Supreme Court delivered its ruling on the Schechter Poultry case, declaring President Roosevelt's National Recovery Act unconstitutional.
During this period, Charles West arrived at Sequoia by seaplane, presumably to discuss the unfolding NRA issue. As the Sequoia sailed, it passed by the USS Arkansas and USS Wyoming. Both naval ships honored the President with a 21-gun salute.
In a related event, Jack Warner, having just arrived in New York City from Europe aboard the White Star Line with his fiancé Ann Alvarado, made his way to Washington, D.C., and then to Annapolis. There, he unexpectedly met director Frank Borzage, who was in the midst of shooting the movie "Shipmates Forever" for Warner Brothers at the Annapolis Naval Academy.

Kelly writes that “In June 1935 Roosevelt required Sequoia to be in New London, CT where from her decks he and Mrs. Roosevelt could watch their son John [This is incorrect. It was Franklin Jr.], a member of the Harvard crew, race against Yale on the Thames River.” Navy history brief also indicates that “During the periods 9-27 June 1934 and 12-25 June 1935 the ship made cruises to New London, Connecticut via the inland waterway. It seems Sequoia cruised without passengers to New London, welcomed President and guests on 6-21 to watch the races (below), and then cruised back to Washington, D.C. without passengers.
