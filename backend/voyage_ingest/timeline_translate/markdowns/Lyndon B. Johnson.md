Notes: Kelly writes “President Johnson was on board Sequoia the day riots broke out in Detroit in 1967. According to Dennis Cardinal(?), who was helmsman at the time, a call came in from J. Edgar Hoover on the red phone installed in the pilothouse. “It was about whether to use federal troops. We heard Johnson give him the go-ahead order over the pilothouse phone” (Kelly 46-47). Detroit Riots broke out early in the morning on Sunday 7-23, but Johnson did not order federal troops into the city until shortly before midnight on Monday 7-24 according to Wikipedia.

Bearss · 1986 Page 161 “While on her trip to the British Isles in the summer of 1967, Lynda purchased a "very broad biblike tie as a gift for her father." They were celebrating his birthday with a party on the Sequoia. At this time Captain Robb was courting Lynda. When her father opened the gift and saw the tie, he exclaimed, "It's a lovely tie, but you ought to give it to Chuck because he is younger.”

1968-05-27 Democrat and Chronicle remarks on LBJ and Gorton’s relationship: “Australia's new Prime Minister John Grey Gorton arrived in Washington for two days of high-level talks, and received from President Johnson an informal but unprecedented welcome. Shortly after Gorton and his wife settled down at the presidential guest residence. Blair House, Johnson invited them to dinner aboard the presidential yacht Sequoia. Of the more than 60 heads of government and chiefs of state who have visited here with Johnson, none has received such an immediate gesture of informality and friendship.”
