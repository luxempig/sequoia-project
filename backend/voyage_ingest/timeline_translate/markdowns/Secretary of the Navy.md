Knox and Sherman didn't believe Seversky, when he said that the Army would have bombers coming off the production line in two weeks with a range of 5,500 miles. They never even heard of such a thing. Nelson said it was true. Imagine, the Army conducting their air war in secrecy from the Secretary of the Navy, but it was being done that way. He had no understanding of the use of air power at all and backed up the most old-hat, out-of-date admirals. It made me feel like wanting to be a hermit living in the mountains, it seemed so mad, unnecessary and insecure for the country”

Ralph Austin Bard (July 29, 1884 – April 5, 1975).
Although he was an active Republican,[7] Bard was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Navy by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat who had once held the same post.[8] Bard was "the only person known to have formally dissented from the use of the atomic bomb without advance warning."[2] Bard's papers (1941–1944) are housed at the Naval Historical Center in Washington, DC.[23]
Diary of John J. McCloy: Diary entries for 1944-07-29 “8:50AM Telephoned Mrs. Gibbs (British Embassy) — invited her to go along to Bard’s birthday party on the Sequoia.”
“7:00PM On board the Sequoia, Bard’s birthday party — brought along Mrs. Gibbs of the British Embassy staff.”


# “Diplomatic Appointment For Woman.
LONDON, November 22. —Britain's first woman attache,
described by a Foreign Office colleague as "an extraordinarily bright and attractive brunette,"
has been appointed to the British Embassy in Washington. She Is Mrs. Betty Gibbs, a widow in her early thirties. She is the second Englishwoman given full diplomatic status. The first was Miss Mary M'Geachy, who also was in Washington. Mrs. Gibbs went to Canada in 1941 demonstrating a British canteen unit, and later took up receptionist work at the British Embassy in Washington. Because all wartime appointments are temporary, Mrs. Gibbs does not rank as a member of the diplomatic service”
