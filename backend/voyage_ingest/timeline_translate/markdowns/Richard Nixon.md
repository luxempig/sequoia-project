**May be worth noting that the 1970-04-29 Daily News discusses the cost of maintenance of the Patricia and the Julie when Nixon decommissions them as Presidential yachts
- They saved an estimated $200,000/year in maintenance
- $45,000 for normal upkeep
- $85,000 for the crews’ salaries and “related expenses”
- $70,000 average for periodic overhauls


**On 1970-07-12, NYT writes that “some months ago, in an attempt to repair the white House’s frayed relations with Congress, it was arranged for President Nixon to take evening trips down the Potomac with members of Congress on the Presidential yacht Sequoia. The President never showed up for even one of the trips, and eventually the idea was abandoned.
1970-07-30 the Atlanta Constitution reports that “Nixon has resumed his practice of inviting small congressional groups for evening cruises down the Potomac in the presidential yacht Sequoia. But he almost never joins the cruise himself.”


1971-10-12 The Courier News says in “Fun and Business Combine Aboard Presidential Yacht” that “the term ‘yacht’ is perhaps a little grand for the squat, unpretentious and slightly long in the tooth Sequoia. Though beautifully kept up (with fresh white paint except for a turquoise strip along the waterline) the 105 foot vessel is otherwise quite indistinguishable from a small tourist cruiser.” (Same in 1971-10-24 Washington Post, w headline “Sequoia slow boat for a jet-age president”


1973-11-28 NYT reports “that the Presidential yacht Sequoia would be temporarily mothballed to conserve fuel but that President Nixon would continue to travel ‘when it’s necessary.’ … the yacht was undergoing ‘normal maintenance’ and would not be used ‘in the foreseeable future.’ One of the reasons, he said, is ‘the energy shortage.’”


(RMD) unclear which voyage this is connected to, but memo in box 32 (subject files) from 1972-06-21 is a letter tp “convey our sincerest apologies for any damage you may have sustained from the wake of the Sequoia and the support craft”; it seems like the Sequoia itself did not sustain any damage but accidentally damaged another boat

93. Memorandum From the President’s Assistant for National Security Affairs (Kissinger) to President Nixon
Washington, July 7, 1969.
Source: National Archives, Nixon Presidential Materials, NSCFiles, Box 74, Vietnam Subject Files, Vietnam, Memos to the President for NSC, 1969. Secret. The date is handwritten on the memorandum. On June 24 Rogers suggested to Nixon creating a policy group on Vietnam chaired by the President and composed of Rogers, Laird, Wheeler, and Kissinger. In a July 2 memorandum Nixon informed Rogers that “I welcome the opportunity for periodic meetings of this group” but demands on his time precluded fixed meetings. Instead Nixon suggested convening the group as the need arose “in lieu of the full NSCand as part of the NSC process.” Nixon also wanted Attorney General Mitchell as part of the group and instructed Kissingerto arrange a meeting for the next week. In his memorandum to the group Kissinger described the meeting on the Sequoia as a “NSC Executive Committee.” (Memorandum from Nixon to Rogers, July 2, and memorandum from Kissinger to Rogers, et al., July 3; both ibid., Box 1008, Haig’s Special Files, Haig’s Vietnam File, Vol. 2 (Apr.–Oct. 1969) [2 of 2])

“Each of the guests … was given an opportunity to speak his views on the economy, issues and problems of the Nixon administration. The consensus expressed was that the ‘seeds were sown three years ago’ for the current lagging economy, and that the situation was ‘inherited rather than created’ by the Nixon administration.” They also discussed the Vietnam war and the 1972 election, during which Nixon did not confirm that he would seek re-election.

Notes: On 1971-10-12, The Courier News remarks that “one of the less impressed guests of the Sequoia was Britain’s Princess Annne who, with her brother, Prince Charles, was taken on a cruise with the Nixon children. The slow pace bored the Princess, who summoned one of the swift Secret Service protective boats, leaped into it and sped out of sight down the river.”
Possibly more info in Julie Eisenhower’s book, Special People
Also Anthony Holden’s biography of Charles might have something in it.
-Also a bit of Yacht Spin in Time Magazine: “Aboard the sluggish presidential yacht Sequoia, which can do only nine knots”
Should be a cruise with Secretary Laird and Rep. Otis Pike around here

Less than two months later on May 17, 1971, Nixon and aides, Kissinger, Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and Colson, set sail for an evening cruise on the presidential yacht the Sequoia. After the craft passed by Washington‘s Tomb at Mount Vernon, Nixon and his men gathered in the wood paneled dining room, drank wine and scotch, dined on New York strip steak and corn on the cob, and plotted their political futures. While the yacht inched quietly down the darkening waters of the Potomac, Nixon looked ahead to 1972 and the battles that were to come against Congress and others over Vietnam and his domestic agenda. As the president nursed his wine, stroking the rim of the glass with a finger, he turned to his trusted political strategist Chuck Colson and said, ―One day we will get them—we‘ll get them on the ground where we want them. And we‘ll stick our heels in, step on them hard and twist—right, Chuck, right?‖ Colson watched the president closely and listened intently to every word. Nixon told his men that they would get their enemies ―on the floor and step on them, crush them, show no mercy.‖ Colson understood instinctively what his boss meant. Henry Kissinger ―smiled and nodded,‖ and while Haldeman said nothing, ―the look on his face was one of hand-rubbing expectation.‖ Colson was the only one who said a word. ―I spoke for all three of us: ̳You‘re right sir, we‘ll get them.‘‖ The obvious dissenter was John Ehrlichman, who ―often a lonely voice of moderation, jerked his head back and stared at the ceiling.‖ Colson recognized it as a seminal moment and that the die had been struck for all that was to come. ―And so on the Sequoia this balmy spring night, a Holy War was declared against the enemy,‖ Colson declared. The Nixonian enemies who had the temerity to oppose their ―noble goals‖ would be dealt with ruthlessly. ―They who differed with us, whatever their motives, must be vanquished. The seeds of destruction were by now already sown—not in them but in us.‖174
