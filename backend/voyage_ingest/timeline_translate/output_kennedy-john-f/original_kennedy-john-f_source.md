President Kennedy (January 20, 1961 to November 22, 1963)
Only two JFK cruises are recorded in Kennedy library, “However, former crew members claim that Kennedy was aboard Sequoia on several other occasions” [Kelly 38] and Johnson’s schedule includes numerous entries of his going to meet Kennedy aboard Sequoia?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I280wlrmtqg . Interesting 2018 interview with Sequoia Captain Arthur Ismay. He discusses his role as captain, the importance of the yacht for entertainment and influence. Highlights a specific time picking up a foreign dignitary. Mentions President Kennedy and his family around 02:30, and how his family began to use the yacht. 04:50 says he met his wife on the Sequoia (perhaps just means while working on the Sequoia)


Wikipedia page: (Kennedy Administration)
“President Kennedy's use of Sequoia is not as well documented as that of other presidents. Government photographers did not accompany him on the yacht, and curiously, immediately after his assassination, an order was given to destroy all personal logs associated with Sequoia's use during the Kennedy Administration.[20] At the time, Paul “Red” Fay, one of Kennedy's closest friends and confidants, served as Acting Secretary of the Navy.
During October 1962, President Kennedy held strategy meetings on Sequoia to discuss the Cuban Missile Crisis.[24] On May 29, 1963, the Kennedys hosted a cruise to celebrate the President's 46th and final birthday. At 8 pm, the couple boarded Sequoia to the music of two orchestras. With 25 friends and family, the President and his guests danced after a meal of roast filet and Dom Perignon.[25][26] In the words of Clement Norton, a close Kennedy family friend who was aboard that night, “You never can imagine anything happier or more normal or nice.”[27] The iconic photographs documenting the President's last birthday were not taken by an official White House photographer, but by the navy officer in charge of Sequoia using his own Kodak Instamatic camera. Mary Pinchot Meyer's presence at the intimate celebration and her murder the following year have been topics of much speculation.
At the time President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas on November 22, 1963 he and the First Lady were scheduled to host friends for a Sunday cruise aboard Sequoia, two days later, on November 24, 1963.[28] In April 1964, the widowed Mrs. Kennedy spent an evening aboard Sequoia with a group of President Kennedy's closest friends. Frank Gannon, the piano player aboard that day, recounts a poignantly sad story of Mrs. Kennedy requesting him to play “Me and My Shadow” a song about being alone.[28] On May 27, 1964, two days before what would have been Kennedy's 47th birthday, his closest family and some friends once again gathered aboard Sequoia for a dinner cruise documented by Kennedy speechwriter and presidential historian, Arthur Schlesinger Jr.”

Summer 1962
Once Upon A Secret pg 77 (Kindle Edition): “The weekends that the President went to Hyannis that summer were hazy, empty, aimless days”
- So rule out weekends he was out of town Summer 1962 (check schedule)
Pg 79: “On late summer weekday afternoons, the President often left the office a little early and took guests on cruises along the Potomac River on the Presidential yacht Sequoia. The Sequoia was a beautiful ship, built in 1925, 104 feet long, with a large main cabin and several decks where guests could sip cocktails while a soft breeze took the edge off Washington’s oppressive heat. Dave Powers was often on board, as were Massachusetts Congressman Torbert ‘Torby’ Macdonald, the President’s roommate from Harvard, and Paul ‘Red’ Fay, the undersecretary of the Navy and an old wartime friend of the President’s. The atmosphere was like a polite fraternity social event. There were more men than women, and the women were not necessarily married to the men they boarded with. I was always introduced as ‘Mimi who works for Pierre in the Press Office’.”
Continued: “One afternoon I was introduced to a woman who immediately sensed that I wasn’t there in a press role. She was not naive. She worked for- and was rumored to be having an affair with- Florida senator George Smathers. As we sipped drinks on the upper deck, she took me aside. “You’re too young to be here,” she said. “You’re going to regret it. All of a sudden you’ll turn around and you’ll be twenty-five and you won’t have a life.”

“The President began his day with a meeting with top advisors including Dean Rusk and Robert McNamara on the Contingency Planning on Berlin. The President met with Senator Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale, the Attorney General of Minnesota. President Kennedy greeted newly appointed members of the Consumers' Advisory Council. The President met with Luis Munoz Marin the Governor of Puerto Rico. After lunch the President met with Senators Mike Mansfield and Richard Russell. He then met with Congressional Candidates. The President then met with John Steele (Time Magazine -Washington Bureau Chief). In the evening the President took a group of guests on a cruise on the Potomac aboard the Sequoia.”

Additional Sources:
Notes: “... she began attending embassy parties and even a White House dinner with President John F. Kennedy on October 19, 1962. She sat on the President’s left, where she proceeded to tell him of her dates with his father, Joseph P. Kennedy, and her affair with [Charles] Addams. That same night, Lyndon Johnson and Hubert Humphrey both asked for her telephone number. The next day, Fontaine and Addams were guests of Assistant Secretary of the Navy Paul "Red" Fay and his wife, Anita, on the Presidential yacht Sequoia. They enjoyed a leisurely trip down the Potomac River, while they had cocktails and dinner. (No Bed of Roses, p. 268). It was also during this time that she found herself a new playmate, then-Ambassador to the United Nations Adlai Stevenson. Their relationship was only a friendship. Stevenson did not want to marry an actress and Fontaine was not about to marry a politician. (No Bed of Roses, p. 269).
