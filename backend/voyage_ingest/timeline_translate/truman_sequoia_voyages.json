The spirit of Theodore Roosevelt, speaking softly and carrying a big stick, moved in his ..\" This seems to contradict Secretary Stimson's diary entry for Monday May 15, 1945 (a few months before bombs were dropped Hiroshima and Nagasaki August 6 and 9, 1945) which describes a meeting in his office that day with British Foreign Secretary Anthony Edan but states his heart condition precluded him from attending the dinner that evening aboard Sequoia with Secretary of the Navy Forrestal.",

Through Magic intercepts, McCloy had known that the emperor was prepared to surrender if assurances to preserve the Japanese monarchy were given. As such, he advised Truman to offer terms of surrender that offered such a guarantee bundled with the implied threat of using the atomic bomb against Japan.",
          "While traveling by boat to the Potsdam Conference (which took place July 17 to August 2, 1945), Secretary of State James Byrnes convinced Truman to ignore McCloy's advice. Eventually, Truman ordered the atomic bombs to be dropped as soon as they were ready.",

          "In 1954, with the transfer of the civilian and military aspects of atomic energy out of the Ministry of Supply, atomic intelligence underwent a comprehensive evaluation, conducted by Admiral Sir Charles Daniel. Central to his review were Welsh's organisations and the critical role of Welsh himself. His 'overt' body in the Ministry of Supply was under the overall command of Sir Frederick Morgan. In his evaluation Morgan was quite unequivocal in his opinion: The peculiar virtue of this small body of people lies in its leader, Lieutenant Commander Eric Welsh, who is not only a natural born genius of precisely the type required for the work in hand but who has, over the years, built-up a truly astonishing network of personal contacts up to the highest, not only in this country but in the United States of America and in Canada...the ramifications of Commander Welsh's activities are world wide and he seems able to command the services of practically anyone."

          "On 3 August, Secretaries Acheson and Johnson held a dinner discussion aboard the President's yacht, Sequoia. The two men agreed that NATO's present command organization appeared \"absolutely hopeless\" and that improvement was imperative. Mr. Acheson wanted the United States to take the lead by organizing a unified command and sending more troops to Europe. Mr. Johnson voiced general agreement but said that such proposals were \"opposed by the General Staff\"-and he personally was disturbed by the insistence upon immediate action. Secretary Acheson replied that, for the moment, he favored nothing more than the organization of a skeleton command staff. After this staff began functioning, perhaps in November or December, the allies could try to create a unified command. Next morning, Secretary Johnson put these proposals before General Bradley and found him agreeable.",
